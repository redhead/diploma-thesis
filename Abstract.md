##  Abstract

This diploma thesis provides general information about the Event Sourcing design pattern and principles of the closely associated CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) design pattern and their usage in the Java programming language. The aim of this thesis was to study these design patterns and apply them to a real-world software project. And finally to describe the advantages and disadvantages of this design over the traditional architecture found in most enterprise Java projects.
