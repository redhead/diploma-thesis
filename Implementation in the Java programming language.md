# Preparation for the implementation

In this chapter, preparation for the implementation of CQRS and event sourcing in the Java programming language and their application to a real software is described. An existing project was used as a base for refactoring into the CQRS and event sourcing principles. The reason why it was decided to refactor an existing project was to try CQRS and ES on a real, non-trivial domain, however, building a project from the ground up would take a lot of time. The existing project was meant to provide some use cases and implementation, on top of which the CQRS and ES infrastructure could be based. Also, as this project uses the traditional layered architecture, it helped with realization of the differences between the two approaches that will be discussed in the next chapters.

Before diving into the refactoring, let's start this chapter with a description of finding a suitable Java framework that would support the refactoring to the CQRS and ES principles. The chapter than continues with introduction of the base project to the reader. This includes the description of the project's goals, its design and implementation details *before* the refactoring.
