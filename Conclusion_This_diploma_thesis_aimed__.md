# Conclusion

This diploma thesis aimed at implementing the event sourcing and CQRS design patterns in the Java programming language. Because these patterns are not widely known in the Java world, they were briefly introduced to the reader together with Domain-Driven Design methodology. These design patterns were studied thoroughly, so they could be applied to a real Java project --- Integration Portal. The refactoring of the system's original design to CQRS and ES was achieved by using Axon Framework, a Java library that supports software development by the principles of the two patterns. The strategy and the process of the refactoring were described, followed by solutions to some problems that were encountered. Finally, the original layered architecture was described pointing out its disadvantages, and compared to the new design.

Let's evaluate the outcome of the thesis, particularly the 

## Evaluation of CQRS and event sourcing
- very interesting and empowering patterns
- very difficult to grasp and master, many shadow areas


## Recommendations
- layered not bad, but think about the design more
- Clean, Hexagonal?
