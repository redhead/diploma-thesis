In the picture **reference needed**, you can see a typical communication flow between the described layers. The flow starts by an HTTP request to the back-end server which is handled by the controller, then the operation is delegated to a service class, which starts a database transaction. The service executes the requested business operation which usually involves retrieving data from the data access layer, modification the data and finally saving the data back to the database. At last, the database transaction is committed and an HTTP response is sent back to the client.
